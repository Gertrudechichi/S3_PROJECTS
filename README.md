# Cost-Efficient S3 Storage: Automating Lifecycle Rules



In this project, an S3 bucket was preconfigured with lifecycle rules to automatically transition and expire objects after a set duration.
This automation brings about operational efficiency and improves cost savings assocaiated with storing documents.
The S3 bucket was configured to host a static website content (Index.html file). 
Also, an IAM user with the necessary permission is allowed to upload images in a desginated prefix of the s3 bucket which will serve the static website.

The bucket's lifecycle policy automatically manages objects, transitioning them through different storage classes based on their age. Initially, objects are stored in S3 Standard. After 30 days, they are moved to Standard-IA for less frequent access. At 60 days, they are transitioned to Glacier Flexible Retrieval for long-term archival. Finally, after 90 days, the objects expire and are deleted, ensuring efficient data management and costÂ optimization.
